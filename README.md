# Piano Planet
Piano Planet is a simple, classic game based off the game Piano Tiles. The game play consists of the player pressing the correct piano note (a keyboard key) when it is asked for. Once pressed, a piano note plays and the row of keys scrolls to the next row. 

The goal of the game is to go through as many piano notes as you can in 10 seconds!

Upon visiting Piano Planet, a user sees instructions and a Play button on the right panel. Once the Play button is pressed, the game board loads on the left and the game starts. The board is randomized each game. A countdown timer kicks off from 10 seconds and counts down to 0. There is a score counter that increments upon each correct key press.
