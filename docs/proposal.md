# Piano Runner
## Background and Overview
Piano Runner is a simple, classic game based off the game Piano Tiles. The game play consists of the player pressing the correct keyboard key (and no other key) when it is asked for (the most current key at the bottom of the page). Once pressed, the row of keys scrolls to the next row.

The goal of the game is to go through the whole piano board without pressing a wrong key in the fastest time!
